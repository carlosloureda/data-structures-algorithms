    "## Eficciency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space and time\n",
    "When we refer to the efficiency of a program, we aren't just thinking about its speed—we're considering both the **time** it will take to run the program and the amount of **space** the program will require in the computer's memory. Often there will be a trade-off between the two, where you can design a program that runs faster by selecting a data structure that takes up more space—or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "An **algorithm** is essentially a series of steps for solving a problem. Usually, an algorithm takes some kind of input (such as an unsorted list) and then produces the desired output (such as a sorted list).\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given problem, there are usually many different algorithms that will get you to exactly the same end result. But some will be much more efficient than others. To be an effective problem solver, you'll need to develop the ability to look at a problem and identify different algorithms that could be used—and then contrast those algorithms to consider which will be more or less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantifying Efficiency\n",
    "It's fine to say \"this algorithm is more efficient than that algorithm\", but can we be more specific than that? Can we quantify things and say how much more efficient the algorithm is?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here is a short (and rather silly) function written in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def some_function(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(2):\n",
    "        n += 100\n",
    "    return n\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Adds 200 to the given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now how about this one?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def other_function(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(100):\n",
    "        n += 2\n",
    "    return n\n",
    "```\n",
    "Adds 200 to the given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these functions have exactly the same end result. But can you guess which one is more efficient?\n",
    "Although the two functions have the exact same end result, one of them iterates many times to get to that result, while the other iterates only a couple of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting lines\n",
    "When counting lines count the times a loop gets executed so in other function it has 103 lines.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Input Size and Efficiency\n",
    "As the input to an algorithm increases, the time required to run the algorithm may also increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The rate of increase (Order)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the input by 10 will cause 10 more lines to get run. Any change in the input is tied to a consistent, proportional change in the number of lines executed. This type of relationship is called a **linear relationship**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for i in range(n):\n",
    "            print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "if n == 1 --> 3 iterations\n",
    "if n == 2 --> 4 iterations\n",
    "if n == 3 --> 9 iterations\n",
    "if n == 4 --> 16 iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "To state this in general terms, if we have an input, nn, then the number of operations will be n^2. This is what we would call a **quadratic** rate of increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "From bigger (slower) to smaller (faster): n! > 2^n > n2 > n*log2n > n > n^1/2, log2n, 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of increase is also called **order**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big O Notation O(...)\n",
    "When describing the efficiency of an algorithm, we could say something like \"the run-time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size\". This can get wordy and it also lacks precision. So as an alternative, mathematicians developed a form of notation called big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"O\" in the name refers to the order of the function or algorithm in question. Order will be express in terms of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "O is always followed by some kind of n: be careful that O(1) is the same as O(n*0 +1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "function decode(input):\n",
    "    create output string\n",
    "    for each letter in input:\n",
    "        get new_letter from letter's location in cipher\n",
    "        add new_letter to output\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is O(2n +2): We look at the number of lines inside the loops (2), This is multiplied by n as it is repeated each time for every n inputm the +2 is beacuse the create and return outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for i in range(n):\n",
    "            print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples we've looked at here, we've been approximating efficiency by counting the number of lines of code that get executed. But when we are thinking about the run-time of a program, what we really care about is how fast the computer's processor is, and how many operations we're asking the processor to perform. Different lines of code may demand very different numbers of operations from the computer's processor. For now, counting lines will work OK as an approximation, but as we go through the course you'll see that there's a lot more going on under the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worst Case And Approximation\n",
    "Approximation => When working with orders like n^2 + 5 it is more or less the same as n^2, we can ditch the +5.\n",
    "Worst Case => Better whitn on the worst case  escenario. (we have the best and the average cases)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency Practice\n",
    "Let's do some exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Quiz 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the run time analysis of the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main(x,y):\n",
    "    if True:\n",
    "        z = x + y\n",
    "   for i in range(10):\n",
    "        z+=i\n",
    "  return z\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is O(1) (In calculations, it will always run 13 lines of code)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Quiz 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the run time analysis of the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main(list_1,list_2):\n",
    "\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for item_1 in list_1:\n",
    "        for item_2 in list_2:\n",
    "            if item_1 == item_2:\n",
    "                count+=1\n",
    "\n",
    "    return count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "When we refer to space complexity, we are talking about how efficient our algorithm is in terms of memory usage. This comes down to the datatypes of the variables we are using and their allocated space requirements. In Python, it's less clear how to do this due to the the underlying data structures using more memory for house keeping functions (as the language is actually written in C).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples of this lesson we will avoid this complexity and assume the following sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type**\t    **Storage size**\n",
    "\n",
    "char\t           1 byte\n",
    "\n",
    "bool\t           1 byte\n",
    "\n",
    "int\t               4 bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "float\t           4 bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "double\t           8 bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that we will be focusing on just the data space being used and not any of the environment or instructional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def our_constant_function():\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = 3 # Type int\n",
    "    y = 345 # Type int\n",
    "    z = 11 # Type int\n",
    "\n",
    "    answer = x+y+z\n",
    "\n",
    "    return answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "4 integers so 4*4 = 16 bytes --> Constant space complexity, amount of space used does not change with input size\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def our_linear_function(n):\n",
    "\n",
    "    n = n # Type int\n",
    "    counter = 0 # Type int\n",
    "    list_ = [] # Assume that the list is empty (i.e., ignore the fact that there is actually meta data stored with Python lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "    while counter < n:\n",
    "        list. append(counter)\n",
    "        counter = counter + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    return list_\n",
    "```\n",
    "So in this example we have two integers (n and counter) and an expanding list, and therefore our space complexity will be 4*n + 8 since we have an expanding integer list and two integer data types. This is an example of linear space complexity.\n"
